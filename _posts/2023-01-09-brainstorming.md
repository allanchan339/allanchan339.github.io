### Remark


# About Enlightening
- [] See if the process of short exposure image is apporxiable by adding gaussian noise

- [] See if a model can be used to formulate the image darken to generate more data

- [] See if we can use diffusion forward to approx. a darken image generation

- [] See if we can retrain a VAE to accept RAW 

## About LDM
- [] Add a shortcut to UNet part and see if the information is more deterministic
