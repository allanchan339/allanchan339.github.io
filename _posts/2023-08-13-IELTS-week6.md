    - e.g. It is often said by some that XXX
    - e.g They believe that XXX

- 吾需要用**他人看法**既寫作罐頭句 
- 可以用幾個point 加埋，再加一句 elaboration 去填曬全段 
### Advantages and Disadvantages (A outweighs B)
Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages? 
- 兩邊都要講齊，但係 Introduction 己經加上 in my opinion, 選左方向先
  - 然後用，我承認XXX 可以XXX，例如XXX
  - 下一段用 nevertheless, despite the advantages above, I believe XXX，然後寫自己方向
- 字數兩段相約
### 1-sided Argumentative Essays
