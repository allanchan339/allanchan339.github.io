Roger Angel | his plan is 'no subsitutes for developing renewable energy: the only permanent solution' (14, 11) | (14, $\cancel{11}$)
Phil Rasch | | I think all of us agree that if we were to end geo-engineering on a given day, then the planet would return to its pre-engineered condition very rapidly, and probably within ten to twenty years. (11) | Geo-engineering plans to inject stratospheric aerosols or to seed coluds would act to cool the plant, and act to increase the extent of sea ice. But all the models suggest some impact on the distribution of precipitation. (11, 13) | (11, $\cancel{13}$)
Dan Lunt ||||A further risk with geo-engineering projects is that your can 'overshoot'. You may bring global temperatures back to pre-industrial levels, but the risk is that the poles will still be warmer than they should be and the tropics will be cooler than before insdustrialisation. Angel's project would have to operate at half strength. (13)|
Martin Sommerkorn |||||Human-induced climate change has brought humanity to a position where we shouldn't exclude thinkgin thoroughly about this topic and its possibilities. (12)|
